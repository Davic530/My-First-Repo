# Hay! This is my first Repo!

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my very first GitHub repository! This is the beginning of my coding journey and I'm excited to see where it goes.

## About This Project

This repo was created to:

- âœ… Learn how to create and manage a GitHub repository
- âœ… Practice writing a proper README file
- âœ… Get familiar with version control and Git basics

## What to Expect

I plan to gradually add more files and features as I learn. Stay tuned for updates!
